## Model formulation:

(SUPER DRAFT - Writing it down to FIX LOT OF ERRORS; just using it as a scratchpad cause
I don't have a pen right now- notations are absolutely wrong)


Writing down the formulation to model mosquitos. The equations are as
follow. The first compartment is the susceptible mosquito:

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = b - \beta S  I_H - \mu_S S $$,

where new susceptibles flow in. $b$ is the birth rate. $\beta$ is the
infection rate and involves both the susceptible density and the
infected host, $I_H$.

The infected mosquitos that flow into the exposed class which is where
individuals have parasites but are not infectious to vertebrate hosts:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta S I_H - \int_{t-\tau}^{t} E(t-\tau)e^{-\mu_I \tau} d \tau - \mu_E,$$
(Damie: Urgh super wrong, actually fix)

this integrodifferential equation can be converted to a series of
ordinary differential equation by using the linear chain trick. By
assuming that the waiting time is a gamma-distribution than the above
equation can be written as:

$$ \frac{dE_0}{dt} = \beta S I_H - n \alpha_E E_0 - \mu_E$$

$$
\frac{dE_n}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n-1} - n \alpha_E E_{n}  - \mu_E. 
$$

Here $n$ is the number of subcompartments within the model and describes
the variability in which individuals transition with the coefficient of
variation being \$ \frac{1}{\sqrt(n)} \$. Those individuals that are
able to survive than go into the infectious compartment. While the
infectious mosquitos don't really have any "development toward a stage",
I think it's easier to model the actual longevity using the linear chain
trick than assuming the exponential.

$$
\frac{dI_0}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n} - n\alpha_II - \mu_I \\
\frac{dI_n}{dt} = n\alpha_I I_{n-1} -  n\alpha_I I_{n} - \mu_I
$$

The full model without double feeding and assuming a Erlang distribution
is then:

$$

\frac{dS}{dt} = b - \beta S I_H - \mu_S S \\
\frac{dE_0}{dt} = \beta S I_H - n \alpha_E E_0 - \mu_E E\\
\frac{dE_n}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n-1} - n \alpha_E E_{n} - \mu_E \\
\frac{dI_0}{dt}=  n \alpha_E E_{n} - n\alpha_II_0 - \mu_I \\
\frac{dI_n}{dt} = n\alpha_I I_{n-1} -  n\alpha_I I_{n} - \mu_I

$$


## The full model formulation with double feeding

We need to create two different compartments,  I think: $D$ for exposed
mosquitos that have doubled fed and $DI$ for the double infected.  I think 
we need the double infected infectious group to be able to play around with the 
senescenece development parameter...

So this is what it would look like with the above modification. I don't have a good
idea of the biting rate/function would look so I'm just going to assume that it's 
some function of vertebrate host? Though, I'm still figuring out if we need the vertebrate
host to simplify the model. 

$$
\frac{dE_0}{dt} = \beta S I_H - f(V_H)E_0 -  n \alpha_E E_0 - \mu_E E_0\\
\frac{dE_n}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n-1} - n \alpha_E E_{n} - f(V_H)E_n - \mu_E \\
$$

The double fed states then look like below (I think? I feel like this is gonna be wonky)

$$
\frac{dD_0}{dt} = f(V_H)E_0 -  n \alpha_D D_0- \mu_D D_0\\
\frac{dD_n}{dt} = f(V_H)D_n +  n \alpha_D D_{n-1} - n \alpha_D D_{n}  - \mu_E \\
$$

Then we have the double-fed individuals go into the $DI$ compartment:

$$
\frac{dDI_0}{dt}=  n \alpha_D D_{n} - n\alpha_{DI}DI_0 - \mu_{DI}DI_0 \\
\frac{dDI_n}{dt} =n\alpha_{DI}DI_{n-1}-  n\alpha_{DI} DI_{n} - \mu_{DI}DI
$$

Look the ass model looks like this:

$$

\frac{dS}{dt} = b - \beta S I_H - \mu_S S \\
\frac{dE_0}{dt} = \beta S I_H - f(V_H)E_0 -  n \alpha_E E_0 - \mu_E E_0\\
\frac{dE_n}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n-1} - n \alpha_E E_{n} - f(V_H)E_n - \mu_E \\
\frac{dI_0}{dt}=  n \alpha_E E_{n} - n\alpha_II_0 - \mu_I \\
\frac{dI_n}{dt} = n\alpha_I I_{n-1} -  n\alpha_I I_{n} - \mu_I \\
\frac{dD_0}{dt} = f(V_H)E_0 -  n \alpha_D D_0- \mu_D D_0\\
\frac{dD_n}{dt} = f(V_H)D_n +  n \alpha_D D_{n-1} - n \alpha_D D_{n}  - \mu_E \\
\frac{dDI_0}{dt}=  n \alpha_D D_{n} - n\alpha_{DI}DI_0 - \mu_{DI}DI_0 \\
\frac{dDI_n}{dt} =n\alpha_{DI}DI_{n-1}-  n\alpha_{DI} DI_{n} - \mu_{DI}DI
$$

Oh god it looks bad, ok gotta check it but i think this is a general framework
to launch ideas from.
