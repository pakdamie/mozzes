## Model formulation:

(SUPER DRAFT - Writing it down to FIX LOT OF ERRORS; just using it as a scratchpad cause
I don't have a pen)


Writing down the formulation to model mosquitos. The equations are as
follow. The first compartment is the susceptible mosquito:

$$ \frac{dS}{dt} = b - \beta S  I_H - \mu_S S $$,

where new susceptibles flow in. $b$ is the birth rate. $\beta$ is the
infection rate and involves both the susceptible density and the
infected host, $I_H$.

The infected mosquitos that flow into the exposed class which is where
individuals have parasites but are not infectious to vertebrate hosts:

$$\frac{dE}{dt} = \beta S I_H - \int_{t-\tau}^{t} E(t-\tau)e^{-\mu_I \tau} d \tau - \mu_E,$$
(Damie: Urgh super wrong, actually fix)

this integrodifferential equation can be converted to a series of
ordinary differential equation by using the linear chain trick. By
assuming that the waiting time is a gamma-distribution than the above
equation can be written as:

$$ \frac{dE_0}{dt} = \beta S I_H - n \alpha_E E_0 - \mu_E$$

$$
\frac{dE_n}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n-1} - n \alpha_E E_{n}  - \mu_E. 
$$

Here $n$ is the number of subcompartments within the model and describes
the variability in which individuals transition with the coefficient of
variation being \$ \frac{1}{\sqrt(n)} \$. Those individuals that are
able to survive than go into the infectious compartment. While the
infectious mosquitos don't really have any "development toward a stage",
I think it's easier to model the actual longevity using the linear chain
trick than assuming the exponential.

$$
\frac{dI_0}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n} - n\alpha_II - \mu_I \\
\frac{dI_n}{dt} = n\alpha_I I_{n-1} -  n\alpha_I I_{n} - \mu_I
$$

The full model without double feeding and assuming a Erlang distribution
is then:

$$

\frac{dS}{dt} = b - \beta S I_H - \mu_S S \\
\frac{dE_0}{dt} = \beta S I_H - n \alpha_E E_0 - \mu_E E\\
\frac{dE_n}{dt} = n \alpha_E E_{n-1} - n \alpha_E E_{n} - \mu_E \\
\frac{dI_0}{dt}=  n \alpha_E E_{n} - n\alpha_II - \mu_I \\
\frac{dI_n}{dt} = n\alpha_I I_{n-1} -  n\alpha_I I_{n} - \mu_I

$$
